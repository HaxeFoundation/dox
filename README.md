## Installation

Install the library via [haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/p/dox):
```sh
haxelib install dox
```


## Usage

> **Note:** Dox requires Haxe 3.1 or higher due to some minor changes in
abstract rtti xml generation. You'll also need an up-to-date haxelib
(requires support for `classPath` in _haxelib.json_)

1. Compile all relevant code with Haxe using `haxe -xml docs/doc.xml -D doc-gen`.
2. Invoke `haxelib run dox -i docs`, where dir points to the .xml file(s) generated by step 1.

**:clipboard: For more details, custom theme creation and options [check out the Dox wiki](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/dox/wiki/)**


## Local development

To test Dox locally, clone the git repo, run `npm install` in root directory. This installs the correct Haxe version using lix and all required dependencies.

After that you can run:
```sh
npx haxe --run Make dox xml pages server
```
This compiles Dox, creates XML's, generates the pages and starts a local dev server at <http://localhost:2000>.


## Local development - testing with nektos/act

The GitHub workflow can be run locally using Nekto's [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) command-line tool. To use it:

1. Install docker
1. Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)
1. Navigate into the root of your project (where the .github folder is located)
1. Run the command `act`
1. On subsequent re-runs you can use `act -r` to reuse previous container which avoids re-installation of components and thus greatly reduces build time.
